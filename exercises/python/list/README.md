# List

Given the list [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], write a program to print the first half values in one line and the last half values in a single line line. Use [n1:n2] notation to get the slices.

---

Write a program that, given a list, produces another list containing all the original values multiplied by 2.

---

Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Use ** operator to get power of a number. Use range() for loops. Use list.append() to add values into a list.

---

Write a program to find all numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 200 and 300 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. Consider the use of str.join() for joining the elements of a list.

---

Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers and generate a list which contains every number. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: '34,67,55,33,12,98' Then, the output should be: ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']

---

Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 'without,hello,bag,world'. The output should be: 'bag,hello,without,world'.

---

Write a function to return, given a list of words, all the words that are longer than min_lenght.

---

Write a function to remove duplicates from a list without using sets.

---

Write a function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member.

---

Write a function to iterate over two lists simultaneously. Given two lists, the function checks if they have the same length and returns a list containing the product of corresponding elements.

---

Write a program for sorting a list of integers in both ascending and descending order.

---

Please write a program to shuffle and print the list [3,6,7,8]. Use the shuffle() method.

---

Please write a program which prints all permutations of [1,2,3]. Use itertools.permutations() to get permutations of list.

---

Write a program to generate a list with 5 random numbers between 100 and 200 inclusive. Use random.sample().
