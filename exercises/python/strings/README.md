# String 

Define a function that can convert an integer into a string.

---

Write a program to concatenate two strings using the .format() method.

---

Write a program to replace all instances of 'dog' with 'bird' in the following sentence: 'I like cats and dogs, but I'd much rather own a dog.'

---

Write a Python function to compose a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string. If the string length is less than 2, return instead of the empty string.
* Input: 'w3resource' -> Output: 'w3ce'
* Input: 'w3' -> Output : 'w3w3' 

---

Write a Python program that, given a string, replaces all occurrences of its first char with '$', except the first char itself.
* Input: restart -> Output: resta$t

---

Write a Python program to produce a single string given two strings as per below. Use slicing combined with the str.format() method().

* Input : 'abc', 'xyz' -> Output: 'xyc abz'

---

Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty string.

---

Write a program to check the validity of password input by users. Following are the criteria for checking the password:

* Minimum length of transaction password: 6
* Maximum length of transaction password: 12
* The password have to be composed of only numbers or only digits

---

Write a Python function to reverses a string if its length is a multiple of 4. Otherwise, it returns the original string.

---

Write a program which accepts a string as input and print 'Yes' if the string is 'yes' in any case form (e.g., Yes, YES, yes, yEs...), otherwise print "No".

---

Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print the characters that have even indexes. Remember slicing supports increments!

* Input: 'H1e2l3l4o5w6o7r8l9d' -> Output: 'Helloworld'

---

Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string. If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.

* Input: 'abc' -> Output: 'abcing'
* Input: 'string' -> Output: 'stringly'

---

Write a Python function to return a string made of 4 copies of the last two characters of a specified string (length must be at least 2).

* Input: 'Python' -> Output: 'onononon'
* Input: 'Exercises' -> Output: 'eseseses'

---

Write a program to split a string on the last occurrence of the delimiter. See the str.rsplit()
