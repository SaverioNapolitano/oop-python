# Array creation routines

Create a new array of 2*2 integers, without initializing entries.

---

Let X = np.array([1,2,3], [4,5,6], np.int32). Create a new array with the same shape and type as X.

---

Create an array with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

---

Create a new array of 3*2 float numbers, filled with ones.

---

Create a new array of 2*5 uints, filled with 6.

---

Create an array of 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 100.

---

Create a 1-D array of 50 evenly spaced elements between 3. and 10., inclusive.

---

Let X = np.array([[ 0, 1, 2, 3], [ 4, 5, 6, 7], [ 8, 9, 10, 11]]). Get the diagonal of X, that is, [0, 5, 10].

---

Create a 2-D array whose diagonal equals [1, 2, 3, 4] and 0's elsewhere.
